Except as forbidden by applicable law, Provider may require that Customer submit applicable Sales Taxes to Provider. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that Customer is tax exempt, provided it gives Provider a valid tax exemption certificate within 30 days of the Effective Date. Provider’s failure to include any applicable tax in an invoice will not waive or dismiss the parties’ rights or obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of Sales Taxes or any other tax or duty, Customer shall separately pay Provider the withheld or deducted amount, over and above fees due.

Customer shall inform Provider of any Excluded Data within Customer Data promptly after discovery (without limiting Provider’s rights or remedies). Customer recognizes and agrees that: (i) the provisions of this Agreement related to Customer Data do not apply to Excluded Data; (ii) Provider has no liability for any failure to provide protections in the Excluded Data Laws (as defined below) or otherwise to protect Excluded Data; and (iii) Provider’s systems are not intended for management or protection of Excluded Data and may not provide adequate or legally required security for Excluded Data.

For the avoidance of doubt, Provider’s liability limits and other rights set forth in this Article 11.1 apply likewise to Provider’s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other representatives.
13. TERM & TERMINATION.
13.1. Term. The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) will commence on the Effective Date and continue for the period set forth in the Order or, if none, for ____. Thereafter, the Term will renew for successive _____ periods, unless either party refuses such renewal by written notice 30 or more days before the renewal date.
13.2. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement for the other’s material breach by written notice specifying in detail the nature of the breach, effective in 30 days unless the other party first cures such breach, or effective immediately if the breach is not subject to cure. Without limiting Provider’s other rights and remedies, Provider may suspend or terminate a Customer’s Client’s or other User’s access to the System at any time, without advanced notice, if Provider reasonably concludes such Customer’s Client or other User has conducted itself in a way that is not consistent with the requirements of the AUP or the other requirements of this Agreement or in a way that subjects Provider to potential liability.
13.3. Effects of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the System and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Documentation and On-Premise Components in its possession or control. The following provisions will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement: (a) any obligation of Customer to pay fees incurred before termination; (b) Articles and Sections 3.2 (Restrictions on Software Rights) 8 (IP & Feedback), 9 (Confidential Information), 10.2 (Warranty Disclaimers), 11 (Indemnification), and 11.1 (Limitation of Liability); and (c) any other provision of this Agreement that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose.
14. MISCELLANEOUS.
14.1. Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors and shall so represent themselves in all regards. Neither party is the agent of the other, and neither may make commitments on the other’s behalf.
14.2. Notices. Provider may send notices pursuant to this Agreement to Customer’s email address provided by Customer, and such notices will be deemed received 24 hours after they are sent. Customer may send notices pursuant to this Agreement to _________________________, and such notices will be deemed received 72 hours after they are sent. In addition, Customer is on notice and agrees that: (a) for claims of copyright infringement, the complaining party may contact ____________________ ; and (b) Provider will terminate the accounts of subscribers who are repeat copyright infringers.
14.3. Force Majeure. No delay, failure, or default, other than a failure to pay fees when due, will constitute a breach of this Agreement to the extent caused by epidemics, acts of war, terrorism, hurricanes, earthquakes, other acts of God or of nature, strikes or other labor disputes, riots or other acts of civil disorder, embargoes, government orders responding to any of the foregoing, or other causes beyond the performing party’s reasonable control.
14.4. Assignment & Successors. Customer may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without Provider’s express written consent. Except to the extent forbidden in this Section 14.3, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective successors and assigns.
14.5. Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law that would render any clause of this Agreement invalid or otherwise unenforceable in any respect. If a provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
14.6. No Waiver. Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Agreement by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than by an authorized representative in an explicit written waiver. No waiver of a breach of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other breach of this Agreement.
14.7. Choice of Law & Jurisdiction: This Agreement will be governed solely by the internal laws of the State of ____________, including without limitation applicable federal law, without reference to: (a) any conflicts of law principle that would apply the substantive laws of another jurisdiction to the parties’ rights or duties; (b) the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; or (c) other international laws. The parties consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of __________ [city or county], _________ [state]. This Section 14.7 governs all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, including without limitation tort claims.
14.8. Conflicts. In case of a conflict among the attachments to this Agreement and this main body, the following order of precedence will govern, with lower numbers governing over higher ones: (1) this main body of this Agreement; (2) any SoW, with more recent Statements of Work taking precedence over later ones; and (3) any Provider policy posted online, including without limitation the AUP. No SoW or other attachment incorporated into this Agreement after execution of this main body will be construed to amend this main body or any earlier attachment unless it specifically states its intent to do so and cites the section or sections amended.
14.9. Construction. The parties agree that the terms of this Agreement result from negotiations between them. This Agreement will not be construed in favor of or against either party by reason of authorship.
14.10. Technology Export. Customer shall not: (a) permit any third party to access or use the System in violation of any U.S. law or regulation; or (b) export any software provided by Provider or otherwise remove it from the United States except in compliance with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall not permit any third party to access or use the System in, or export such software to, a country subject to a United States embargo (as of the Effective Date, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria).
14.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous writings, negotiations, and discussions with respect to its subject matter. Neither party has relied upon any such prior or contemporaneous communications.
14.12. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts. Each counterpart will be an original, but all such counterparts will constitute a single instrument.
14.13. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except through a written agreement by authorized representatives of each party. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.13, Provider may revise the AUP at any time by posting a new version of either at the Website, and such new version will become effective on the date it is posted; provided if such amendment materially reduces Customer’s rights or protections, notice and consent will be subject to the requirements above in this Section 14.13.
IN WITNESS THEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
