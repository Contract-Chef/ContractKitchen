2. THE SAAS. 
2.1.	Use of the SaaS. During the Term, Customer may access and use the SaaS pursuant to the terms of any outstanding Order, including such features and functions as the Order requires.
2.2.	Service Levels. Provider shall provide the remedies listed in the SLA for any failure of the SaaS listed in the SLA. Such remedies are Customer’s sole remedy for any failure of the SaaS, and Customer recognizes and agrees that if the SLA does not list a remedy for a given failure, it has no remedy; provided this sentence does not restrict any Customer right to terminate this Agreement for breach where applicable. Credits issued pursuant to the SLA apply to outstanding or future invoices only and are forfeit upon termination of this Agreement. Provider is not required to issue refunds or to make payments against such credits under any circumstances, including without limitation after termination of this Agreement.
2.3.	Documentation: Customer may reproduce and use the Documentation solely as necessary to support Users’ use of the SaaS.
2.4.	SaaS Revisions. Provider may revise the SLA or the features and functions of the SaaS at any time, provided no such revision materially reduces features or functionality provided pursuant to an outstanding Order.
2.5.	Customer’s Clients. Subject to the provisions below of this Section 2.4, Customer may authorize Customer’s Clients to access and use the SaaS in such numbers and according to such restrictions as are set forth in the applicable Order, solely for the following purposes: ___________________.

Except as forbidden by applicable law, Provider may require that Customer submit applicable Sales Taxes to Provider. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that Customer is tax exempt, provided it gives Provider a valid tax exemption certificate within 30 days of the Effective Date.

Nothing in this Agreement precludes Provider from asserting rights or defenses it may have under applicable law related to such requests.

Customer shall inform Provider of any Excluded Data within Customer Data promptly after discovery (without limiting Provider’s rights or remedies). Customer recognizes and agrees that: (i) the provisions of this Agreement related to Customer Data do not apply to Excluded Data; (ii) Provider has no liability for any failure to provide protections in the Excluded Data Laws (as defined below) or otherwise to protect Excluded Data; and (iii) Provider’s systems are not intended for management or protection of Excluded Data and may not provide adequate or legally required security for Excluded Data.

(This Section 7.3 does not limit either party’s right to injunctive relief for breaches not listed.)

INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDER’S NEGLIGENCE.

If Customer fails to assume the defense on time to avoid prejudicing the defense, Provider may defend the Indemnified Claim, without loss of rights pursuant to this Article 9. Provider will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it or a Provider Associate admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects either of them to any ongoing affirmative obligation.

12.6.	No Waiver. Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Agreement by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than by an authorized representative in an explicit written waiver.
