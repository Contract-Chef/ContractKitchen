This Consulting Agreement (this “Agreement”) is by and between ______________, an individual and a resident of California (“Consultant”) and ___________, a __________________ whose principal place of business is _______________ (“Company”). This Agreement includes any current or future statement of work specifically referencing this Agreement and executed by each party (any “SoW”), and all such SoW’s are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.
The parties have agreed that Consultant will provide such professional services as the parties may agree, now and pursuant to future statements of work. Therefore, in consideration for the commitments set forth below, the adequacy of which consideration the parties hereby acknowledge, the parties agree as follows.
1.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. Consultant shall provide the services set forth in each SoW (“Professional Services”). Company shall provide any assistance and cooperation necessary or convenient to facilitate the Professional Services or called for in an SoW.
2.  PAYMENT. 
2.1.	Fees & Reimbursement. Company shall: (a) pay Consultant the fees as set forth in each SoW; and (b) reimburse such expenses as Consultant reasonably incurs in provision of Professional Services. Amounts listed in SoW’s are estimates of Professional Services fees and will not be binding, except to the extent that the SoW specifically provides to the contrary.
2.2.	Taxes. Amounts due under this Agreement are payable to Consultant without deduction and are net of any tax, tariff, duty, or assessment imposed by any government authority (national, state, provincial, or local), including without limitation any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, property, withholding, or value added tax withheld at the source. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of such taxes or duties, Company shall separately pay Consultant the withheld or deducted amount. However, the preceding two sentences do not apply to taxes based on Consultant’s net income.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is in Consultant’s possession at the time of disclosure; (ii) is independently developed by Consultant without use of or reference to Confidential Information; (iii) becomes known publicly, before or after disclosure, other than as a result of Consultant’s improper action or inaction; or (iv) is approved for release in writing by Company.
3.2.	Nondisclosure. Consultant shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than to facilitate his/her duties as assigned by Company. Consultant shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without Company’s prior written consent and shall exercise reasonable care to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant may disclose Confidential Information as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. Consultant shall give Company prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Company in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at Company’s expense.
3.3.	Retention of Rights. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of Confidential Information or grant a license thereto. Company will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all Confidential Information.
3.4.	Exception & Immunity. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 USC Section 1833(b), Consultant is on notice and acknowledges that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement:

(b)	USE OF TRADE SECRET INFORMATION IN ANTI-RETALIATION LAWSUIT. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual- (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
