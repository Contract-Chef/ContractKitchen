INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT
This Information Technology Master Services Agreement (this “Agreement”) is by and between ______________, a _________________ whose principal place of business is _________________ (“Vendor”) and ___________, a __________________ whose principal place of business is _______________ (“Customer”). This Agreement includes any current or future statement of work on the form attached here to as Attachment A and executed by each party (any “SoW”), and all such documents are incorporated by this reference.
Vendor provides information technology professional services related to _______________. The parties have agreed that Vendor will provide such professional services as the parties may agree, now and pursuant to future statements of work. Therefore, in consideration for the commitments set forth below, the adequacy of which consideration the parties hereby acknowledge, the parties agree as follows.
1.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. 
1.1.	Provision of Professional Services. Vendor shall provide the services set forth in each SoW (“Professional Services”), and Customer shall provide any assistance and cooperation necessary or convenient to facilitate the Professional Services, or called for in an SoW. Vendor may employ subcontractors in the provision of Professional Services, but Vendor will be responsible and liable for such subcontractors’ acts and omissions related to this Agreement.
1.2.	Deliverables. 
(a)	Acceptance & Rejection. Software or other deliverables created pursuant to Professional Services (“Deliverables”) will be considered accepted (“Acceptance”) (i) when Customer provides Vendor written notice of acceptance or (ii) ___ days after delivery, if Customer has not first provided Vendor with written notice of rejection. Customer may reject a Deliverable only in the event that it materially deviates from its specifications and requirements listed in the applicable SoW and only via written notice setting forth the nature of such deviation. In the event of such rejection, Vendor shall correct the deviation and redeliver the Deliverable within ___ days. After redelivery pursuant to the previous sentence, the parties shall again follow the acceptance procedures set forth in this Subsection 1.2(a). This Subsection 1.2(a), in conjunction with Customer’s right to terminate for material breach where applicable, sets forth Customer’s only remedy and Vendor’s only liability for failure of Deliverables.
(b)	License to Deliverables. Effective upon Acceptance of each Deliverable, Vendor grants Customer a nonexclusive, fully paid, royalty-free license to reproduce, modify, and use such Deliverable as necessary for Customer’s internal business purposes, provided Customer complies with the restrictions set forth below in Subsection 1.2(c).
(c)	Restrictions on Deliverables Rights. Customer shall not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or sublicense any Deliverables (including without limitation any derivative work thereof).  Vendor retains ownership of all Deliverables, and Customer receives no right, title, or interest in or to Deliverables except as specifically set forth in Subsection 1.2(b) above.
2.  PAYMENT. 
2.1.	Fees & Reimbursement. Customer shall: (a) pay Vendor the fees as set forth in each SoW; and (b) reimburse such expenses as Vendor reasonably incurs in provision of Professional Services. Amounts listed in SoW’s are estimates of Professional Services fees and will not be binding, except to the extent that the SoW specifically provides to the contrary. Vendor will not be required to refund fees under any circumstances.
2.2.	Taxes. Amounts due under this Agreement are payable to Vendor without deduction and are net of any tax, tariff, duty, or assessment imposed by any government authority (national, state, provincial, or local), including without limitation any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, property, withholding, or value added tax withheld at the source. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of such taxes or duties, Customer shall separately pay Vendor the withheld or deducted amount. However, the preceding two sentences do not apply to taxes based on Vendor’s net income.
3.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  “Confidential Information” refers to the following items one party to this Agreement (“Discloser”) discloses to the other (“Recipient”): (a) any document Discloser marks “Confidential”; (b) any information Discloser orally designates as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, provided Discloser confirms such designation in writing within __ business days; (c) ______________________ ; and (d) any other nonpublic, sensitive information Recipient should reasonably consider a trade secret or otherwise confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is in Recipient’s possession at the time of disclosure; (ii) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Confidential Information; (iii) becomes known publicly, before or after disclosure, other than as a result of Recipient’s improper action or inaction; or (iv) is approved for release in writing by Discloser. Recipient is on notice that the Confidential Information may include Discloser’s valuable trade secrets.
3.1.	Nondisclosure. Recipient shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than to facilitate the Professional Services (the “Purpose”). Recipient: (a) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any employee or contractor of Recipient unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the Purpose and executes a nondisclosure agreement with Recipient with terms no less restrictive than those of this Article 3; and (b) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without Discloser’s prior written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Recipient shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information that comes to Recipient’s attention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. Recipient shall give Discloser prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Discloser in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at Discloser’s expense.
3.2.	Injunction. Recipient agrees that breach of this Article 3 would cause Discloser irreparable injury, for which monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation, and that in addition to any other remedy, Discloser will be entitled to injunctive relief against such breach or threatened breach, without proving actual damage or posting a bond or other security.
3.3.	Termination & Return. With respect to each item of Confidential Information, the obligations of Section 3.1 above (Nondisclosure) will terminate ___________ after the date of disclosure; provided that such obligations related to Confidential Information constituting Discloser’s trade secrets will continue so long as such information remains subject to trade secret protection pursuant to applicable law. Upon termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall return all copies of Confidential Information to Discloser or certify, in writing, the destruction thereof.
3.4.	Retention of Rights. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of Confidential Information or grant a license thereto. Discloser will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all Confidential Information.
3.5.	Exception & Immunity. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 USC Section 1833(b), Recipient is on notice and acknowledges that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement:

An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that- (A) is made- (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.
(b)	Use of Trade Secret Information in Anti-Retaliation Lawsuit. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual- (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

4.3.	From Each Party.
