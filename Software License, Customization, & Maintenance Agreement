Except as forbidden by applicable law, Provider may require that Customer submit applicable Sales Taxes to Provider. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that Customer is tax exempt, provided it gives Provider a valid tax exemption certificate within 30 days of the Effective Date.

(“Feedback” refers to any suggestion or idea for modifying any of Provider’s products or services.)
7. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  
7.1.	Confidential Information Defined. “Confidential Information” refers to the following one party to this Agreement (“Discloser”) discloses to the other (“Recipient”): (a) any document Discloser marks “Confidential”; (b) any information Discloser orally designates as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, provided Discloser confirms such designation in writing within __ business days; (c) any source code disclosed by Provider and any names of actual or potential customers disclosed by Customer, whether or not marked as confidential; and (d) any other nonpublic, sensitive information Recipient should reasonably consider a trade secret or otherwise confidential.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Recipient shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information that comes to Recipient’s attention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. Recipient shall give Discloser prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Discloser in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest, limit, or protect such required disclosure, at Discloser’s expense.
7.3.	Injunction. Recipient agrees that: (a) no adequate remedy exists at law if it breaches any of its obligations in Section 7.2 (Nondisclosure); (b) it would be difficult to determine the damages resulting from its breach of Section 7.2, and such breach would cause irreparable harm to Discloser; and (c) a grant of injunctive relieve provides the best remedy for any such breach, without any requirement that Discloser prove actual damage or post a bond or other security. Recipient waives any opposition to such injunctive relief or any right to such proof, bond, or other security. (This Section 7.3 does not limit either party’s right to injunctive relief for breaches not listed.)
7.4.	Termination & Return. The obligations of this Article 7 will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Recipient shall return all copies of Confidential Information to Discloser or certify, in writing, the destruction thereof.
7.5.	Retention of Rights.

Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Agreement by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than by an authorized representative in an explicit written waiver. No waiver of a breach of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other breach of this Agreement.
14.8.	U.S. Government Restricted Rights. This Section 14.8 applies to all acquisitions of the Software (including without limitation Deliverables) or Documentation by or for the United States federal government, including by any prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) under any contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other activity with the Federal government. The Software and related documentation were developed at private expense and are “Commercial Items,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software Documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 (for civilian agencies) and 48 C.F.R. §227.7202 (for Department of Defense agencies), as applicable. Consistent with and subject to 48 CFR 12.212  and 48 CFR 227.7202-1 through 227.7702-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only such rights as are granted to all other end-users pursuant to the terms herein. Any provisions of this Agreement inconsistent with federal procurement regulations or other federal law are not enforceable against the U.S. Government. Unpublished rights are reserved under the copyright laws of the United States. Customer shall not remove or deface any restricted rights notice or other legal notice appearing in the Software or on any packaging or other media associated with the Software. This Section 14.8 does not grant Customer any rights not specifically set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation any right to distribute the Software to the United States federal government.
14.9.	Bankruptcy Rights. The rights and licenses in Sections 2.1 (License) and 9.3 (Escrow License) of this Agreement (the “License Provisions”) are licenses to “intellectual property,” as defined in Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Sections 101, et seq.). If Provider is subject to any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code, and Provider as debtor in possession or its trustee in bankruptcy rejects this Agreement, Customer may, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 365(n)(1) and (2), retain any and all rights granted to it under the License Provisions, to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Section 14.9 will not be construed to limit or restrict any right or remedy not set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation the right to retain any license or authority this Agreement grants pursuant to any provision other than the License Provisions.
14.10.	Choice of Law & Jurisdiction: This Agreement will be governed solely by the internal laws of ________________, without reference to: (a) any conflicts of law principle that would apply the substantive laws of another jurisdiction to the parties’ rights or duties; (b) the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; or (c) other international laws. The parties consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of __________ [city or county], _________ [state] for all cases and controversies arising out of or related to this Agreement, including without limitation tort cases.
14.11.	Conflicts. If any conflict between Attachment A or Attachment B and this main body of this Agreement, this main body will govern.

14.13.	Technology Export. Customer shall not: (a) permit any third party to access or use the Software in violation of any U.S. law or regulation; or (b) export the Software or otherwise remove it from the United States except in compliance with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall not permit any third party to access or use the Software in, or export the Software to, a country subject to a United States embargo (as of the Effective Date, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria).
14.14.	Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous writings, negotiations, and discussions with respect to its subject matter. Neither party has relied upon any such prior or contemporaneous communications.
14.15.	Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts. Each counterpart will be an original, but all such counterparts will constitute a single instrument.
